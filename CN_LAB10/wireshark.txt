1. Overview of Wireshark in the Image

Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer that captures and inspects packets. In this image, it is being used to capture live network traffic on the eno1 network interface.


2. Main Sections of Wireshark

The interface in the image consists of:

    Menu Bar (topmost section): Options for file operations, capturing, analyzing, and filtering packets.
    Toolbar (below menu bar): Quick access buttons for starting/stopping capture, applying filters, and navigating packets.
    Packet List Pane (top section): Displays all captured packets with columns such as No., Time, Source, Destination, Protocol, Length, and Info.
    Packet Details Pane (middle section): Shows the selected packet's details, broken down by protocol layers.
    Packet Bytes Pane (bottom section): Displays the raw packet data in hexadecimal and ASCII format.

3. Packet List Pane Explanation

This section displays a list of captured packets. The following columns are visible:

    No.: Packet number in the capture session.
    Time: Timestamp of when the packet was captured.
    Source: The sender's IP or MAC address.
    Destination: The receiver's IP or MAC address.
    Protocol: Indicates the protocol (e.g., TCP, MDNS, STP).
    Length: Size of the packet in bytes.
    Info: Additional details about the packet (e.g., flags, sequence numbers).

4. Selected Packet Analysis

Packet No. 1993 is selected, and its details are displayed below:

    Ethernet II:
        Source MAC: Micro-St_60:75:65 (00:d8:61:60:75:65)
        Destination MAC: Netgear_68:a2:7c (20:e5:2a:68:a2:7c)
    IPv4 Header:
        Source IP: 192.168.32.26
        Destination IP: 192.168.1.100
    TCP Header:
        Source Port: 46310
        Destination Port: 8090 (commonly used for web applications)
        Sequence Number: 0
        Length: 0 (Indicates this might be a control packet like SYN, FIN, or ACK)

5. Observed Protocols

Various network protocols are present in the capture:

    STP (Spanning Tree Protocol): Used for preventing loops in a network.
    MDNS (Multicast DNS): Used for resolving hostnames in local networks.
    TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): Used for reliable data transmission between devices.
    RST, FIN, ACK Flags in TCP: Indicate connection termination between devices.

6. Packet Bytes Pane

Displays the raw data of the packet in hexadecimal and ASCII. The breakdown helps in low-level network analysis, debugging issues, or security auditing.
